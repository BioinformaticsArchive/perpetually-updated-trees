Alignment has 94 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 45.39%

RAxML computation of SH-like support values on a given tree

Using 2 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
