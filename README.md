# PUmPER Phylogenies Updated PERperpetually

PUmPER is a framework to build automated pipelines that can perpetually update phylogenetic trees. PUmPER makes use of PHLAWD and RAxML-Light to perpetually update Genbank datasets and simultaneously update inferred phylogenetic trees.

You can learn how to setup the system at the [wiki page for installation](https://github.com/fizquierdo/perpetually-updated-trees/wiki/Setup)

To get started, and build your first PUmPER phylogenetic pipeline, you can follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/fizquierdo/perpetually-updated-trees/wiki/Getting-Started) 

PUmPER is work-in-progress and under continuous development.
