## PUmPER: Phylogenies Updated PERperpetually

PUmPER is a framework to build automated pipelines that can perpetually update phylogenetic trees. PUmPER makes use of [PHLAWD](https://phlawd.net) and [RAxML-Light](https://github.com/stamatak/RAxML-Light-1.0.5) to perpetually update Genbank datasets and simultaneously update inferred phylogenetic trees.

You can learn how to setup the system at the [wiki page for installation](https://github.com/fizquierdo/perpetually-updated-trees/wiki/Setup)

To get started, and build your first PUmPER phylogenetic pipeline, you can follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/fizquierdo/perpetually-updated-trees/wiki/Getting-Started) 

PUmPER is work-in-progress, available under the GNU GPL license, and under continuous development.
