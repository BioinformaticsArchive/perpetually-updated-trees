perpetually-updated-trees
=========================

The perpetual tree updater is an automated pipeline which makes use of [PHLAWD](www.phlawd.net) and [RAxML-Light](https://github.com/stamatak/RAxML-Light-1.0.5) to perpetually update Genbank datasets and simultaneously update inferred phylogenetic trees.

You can learn how to setup the system at the [wiki page for installation](https://github.com/fizquierdo/perpetually-updated-trees/wiki/Setup)

To get started, you can follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/fizquierdo/perpetually-updated-trees/wiki/Getting-Started) 

This is work-in-progress and under continuous development.
